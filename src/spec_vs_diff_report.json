  "summary": "The implementation covers most core requirements for the Smart Grama platform, including authentication, complaint management, tree plantation, water harvesting, solar scheme modules, admin analytics dashboard with charts, status tracking, and UI components. However, several requirements are either missing or not fully implemented based on the available diff evidence.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "JWT-based session management with role-based access control",
      "reason": "The backend uses Internet Identity (Principal-based authentication) instead of JWT tokens as specified. No JWT token generation or validation is evident in the backend code.",
